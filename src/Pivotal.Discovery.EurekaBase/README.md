This project contains the Pivotal Discovery Client.  This client provides a generalized interface to service registries.

Currently the client only supports [Spring Cloud Services Eureka Server](http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/service-registry/), but in the future we will add support for others in the future.

For more information on how to use this component see the online [Steeltoe documentation](https://steeltoe.io/).
